This example will show how to create a more advanced version of middleware in Go.

A middleware in itself simply takes a `http.HandlerFunc` as one of its parameters, wraps it and returns a new `http.HandlerFunc` for the server to call.

Here we define a new type `Middleware` which makes it eventually easier to chain multiple middlewares together. This idea is inspired by Mat Ryersâ€™ talk about Building APIs.

This snippet explains in detail how a new middleware is created.

```go
func createNewMiddleware() Middleware {
    // Create a new Middleware
    middleware := func(next http.HandlerFunc) http.HandlerFunc {
        // Define the http.HandlerFunc which is called by the server eventually
        handler := func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
            // ... do middleware things

            // Call the next middleware/handler in chain
            next(w, r)
        }

        // Return newly created handler
        return handler
    }

    // Return newly created middleware
    return middleware
}
```
